Coming off a 5-11, last-place season in the competitive NFC East, there is little faith in general manager Dave Gettleman and coach Pat Shurmur leading a turnaround anytime soon.

New York is a worse team for the short term with Beckham, defensive end Olivier Vernon and safety Landon Collins all departing. But in return, the Giants are up to 12 picks in the 2019 NFL Draft, and they have have two solid new starters in right guard Kevin Zeitler and safety Jabrill Peppers.

Gettleman defended the marquee house-cleaning by showing confidence the Giants will do right by the assets they have going forward.

""You can win while you build a roster,"" Gettleman said in team-issued statement. ""We do have a plan, and this part of it.""

How might the Giants go about executing the next stages? Let's take a look:

Quarterback plan

Oddly, the only certainty for the Giants now is that Eli Manning, 38, will remain on the roster as the starting quarterback. Emotions from ownership aside, that's not crazy. It keeps New York from forcing itself into taking a QB early in the draft.

With the No. 6 and No. 17 overall picks this year, the Giants are right to do their due diligence scouting Kyler Murray, Dwayne Haskins, Daniel Jones and Drew Lock. But unless one of them blows New York away between now and April 27, they should pass on a QB in this year's draft and wait for Manning’s successor in 2020, when Tua Tagovailoa and Justin Herbert top a stronger class.

MORE: Giants among losers of free agency

If it's a QB in 2019, Jones or Lock at No. 17 would make more sense. The Giants then could use No. 6 to land a can't-miss edge rusher or offensive tackle, the kind of pick running back Saquon Barkley felt like at No. 2 overall last year.

The third and best option, which gets the Giants someone to groom for the near future while hedging bets on Manning now, is trading their high second-round pick (No. 37) to the Cardinals for Josh Rosen. That’s reportedly around Arizona's asking price for last year's first-round QB so the Cardinals can clear a path to take Murray No. 1 this year.

The Giants would still have 11 picks and plenty to use toward supporting their passing game.

Draft plan

Zeitler upgrades an offensive line that will also feature Nate Solder, Will Hernandez and Spencer Pulley in 2019. But right tackle is a glaring weakness. Florida's Jawaan Taylor, Alabama's Jonah Williams and Washington State's Andre Dillard must be play for either of New York's first-round picks.

With both of those picks, the Giants also can't go wrong taking the best defensive player available. Kentucky’s Josh Allen or Mississippi State's Montez Sweat would be the edge-rushing guys to consider most.

MOCK DRAFT 2019:

Giants take chance on QB early

With No. 17, Florida State's Brian Burns can be considered at the position. That pick also lines up with the draft's premier inside linebackers, LSU's Devin White or Michigan’s Devin Bush, or a top corner such as LSU's Greedy Williams, Georgia's Deandre Baker or Washington's Byron Murphy.

If the Giants were to go wide receiver at No. 17 — No. 6 is too early — then Oklahoma’s Marquise Brown is an option. But considering the early strength of the draft is defense, and the wideout class is deep with sleepers, they can target their Beckham replacement later. With extra picks deeper in the draft, the Giants have the ability to trade up and get who they want on Day 2.

Rest of free agency plan

The Giants started big on the open market, but now comes the small ball. After moving the Beckham and Vernon contracts, they have about $26 million left under the salary cap.

When Gettleman was GM of the Panthers, he won Sporting News' NFL Executive of the Year award after he built Carolina into a Super Bowl team in 2015. He made many shrewd lower-cost moves for aging veterans who had been on multiple teams but still had something left to contribute.

The Giants' signing of receiver Golden Tate lines up with that, much like the Panthers’ 2013 signing of Ted Ginn Jr. to offset the release of Steve Smith. Markus Golden also is a cheaper fit to help rush the edge in a defense familiar to him vs. Vernon.

The big spending on Nate Solder last offseason was an anomaly out of desperation. The Giants spent a little less on guard Patrick Omameh, and after little return, they cut him in November.

To many, Gettleman’s ways are cold, calculated and, well, cheap. But in the NFL, that has proven to be a better path to winning games as opposed to splashy, expensive signings.

Even in the constant win-now nature of the league, a little patience is still required. By moving a valuable commodity like Beckham, the Giants have put pressure on themselves to hit on everything just right in the fallout. It won't be easy, but the path to get it done is being laid.

Until a drastic development occurs to suggest this won't happen, this will be my pick for the Cardinals.

Nick Bosa, EDGE, Ohio State

I had an internal battle this week regarding whether or not the 49ers would still pick Bosa after trading a 2020 second-round pick for Dee Ford . After initially thinking they wouldn't, I now think they would. Solomon Thomas being placed on the trade block wouldn't shock me.

Josh Allen, EDGE, Kentucky

The Jets apparently agreed to a deal with Anthony Barr but before the contract was made official, Barr backed out, and re-signed with the Vikings. Reports indicated Jets defensive coordinator Gregg Williams planned to place Barr on the edge, instead of at the off-ball spot he's played in Minnesota. In other words, New York still has a glaring need on the outside of their defensive line. Allen fills that void.

Quinnen Williams, DT, Alabama

The Raiders have Maurice Hurst inside, and they drafted P.J. Hall in the third round a year ago. That shouldn't stop them from drafting Quinnen. He represents better value than any edge rusher here.

Devin White, LB, LSU

With Kwon Alexander gone, and Lavonte David nearing his 30th birthday, the Buccaneers have to get more athletic at linebacker, and they do that by nabbing White.

Jawaan Taylor, OT, Florida

Taylor is the exact type of powerful offensive lineman I can see Dave Gettleman loving to pick early in the draft.

Rashan Gary, EDGE, Michigan

In a very short amount of time, the Jaguars went from having arguably the league's deepest pass rush to a group in need of an edge rusher. Gary is supremely explosive but lacks polish, yet can play anywhere up front.

Greedy Williams, CB, LSU

The Lions added Trey Flowers in free agency and have nice young collection of defenders up front. While edge will be considered, Matt Patricia, Bob Quinn and Co. decide to go with Williams, who'd round out an athletic cornerback trio featuring Darius Slay and newcomer Justin Coleman.

Ed Oliver, DT, Houston

I've gone back and forth between Oliver and Jonah Williams in this slot for a while, and although the Bills still have some open starting spots on their offensive line, Buffalo has added Ty Nsekhe, Jon Feliciano, Spencer Long , and Mitch Morse up front in free agency but no one on the interior of the defensive line.

Dwayne Haskins, QB, Ohio State

This very well could be Drew Lock , but I can envision John Elway taking his chances on a quarterback more in need of a redshirt season in Haskins. In theory, because of his age and lack of experience, Haskins has a higher ceiling than Lock.

Jonah Williams, OT, Alabama

Linebacker -- namely Devin Bush -- will be considered, but Williams provides more return on investment, and he directly helps Andy Dalton.

T.J. Hockenson, TE, Iowa

With the outside pass rush clearly addressed in free agency, the Packers have more leeway in the draft, and go with a youthful, energetic tight end with big potential in Hockenson.

Garrett Bradbury, C, NC State

At this point, the Dolphins appear to be a team perfectly content with landing near the top of the 2020 Draft. This is a bit of a reach for Bradbury, but with a year of strength and conditioning at the NFL level, he can become a high-end pivot in his second season, when he'd presumably be snapping to someone like Tua Tagovailoa, Justin Herbert , or Jake Fromm.

Andre Dillard, OT, Washington State

The Falcons released starting right tackle Ryan Schraeder, and the super-athletic Dillard would fill that vacancy immediately on a pass-happy club in Atlanta.

Noah Fant, TE, Iowa

I can't get away from two Iowa tight ends in the top 15. It'd be too awesome. Fant can be a yards-after-the-catch specialist in Jay Gruden's system.

D.K. Metcalf, WR, Ole Miss

With Daryl Williams re-signed, and Taylor Moton a promising young tackle, Carolina can turn its attention to a huge, linearly explosive option in Metcalf who'd help accentuate Cam Newton's downfield passing skills.

Dalton Risner, OL, Kansas State

After trading Rosen to the Giants for this pick, the Cardinals add a high-energy, highly technical lineman in Risner who could conceivably play any of the five offensive line positions.

Chris Lindstrom, OG, Boston College

Lindstrom doesn't quite have the length or size to play tackle in the NFL, although he's been gifted with tackle feet and loads of power. The Vikings have to go offensive line heavy in this draft.

Drew Lock, QB, Missouri

Marcus Mariota is playing on his fifth-year option and was picked by the previous regime. This selection of Lock is insurance for the most vital position on the field.

Devin Bush, LB, Michigan

Fantastic selection for Pittsburgh here. The Steelers need more athleticism in their linebacker group, and Devin exudes just that.

Hakeem Butler, WR, Iowa State

The Seahawks are prime trade-down candidates, but they stay pat and give Russell Wilson a tall, speedy, athletic wideout with an enormous catch radius.

A.J. Brown, WR, Ole Miss

The Ravens want to go old-school, with a power running scheme tailored to bludgeon smaller nickel defenses. But they also need to give Lamar Jackson legit weapons on the outside. Brown is a remarkable yards-after-the-catch wideout with a muscular frame.

Yodny Cajuste, OT, West Virginia

The Texans have been strangely quiet on the free-agent market, and they still have one of the league's worst offensive lines. Cajuste will be tested by speed rushers but has the size, length, and power to be an instant starter at left tackle.

From Bears Montez Sweat, EDGE, Mississippi State

Mike Mayock would be ecstatic to be able to draft Sweat, a highly athletic edge rusher who converts speed to a lot of power.

Deandre Baker, CB, Georgia

The Eagles roster remains one of the best in the league, but the secondary is lacking. Baker is an NFL-ready man-to-man cornerback.

Brian Burns, EDGE, Florida State

The Colts need more juice around the corner, and Burns definitely brings that. As he continues to add weight, he should become more effective.

From Cowboys Josh Jacobs, RB, Alabama

I can see Jon Gruden getting a feature back he can call his own. He lands the consensus top running back here.

Christian Wilkins, DT, Clemson

A logical pick to place between Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram in Gus Bradley's system. Wilkins can do it all on the inside.

Clelin Ferrell, EDGE, Clemson

The Chiefs have to add some talent to their defensive line after cutting Justin Houston and trading Dee Ford. Ferrell is an ascending player with serious length and flashes of All-Pro type bend around the corner.

From Saints Cody Ford, OT/OG, Oklahoma

Same pick from last week. It's too perfect. Ford can slot at one of the guard spots then move to right tackle after Bryan Bulaga moves on.

Dexter Lawrence, DT, Clemson

With Ndamukong Suh likely playing elsewhere in 2019, the Rams re-invest in their defensive line once again with an oversized, overwhelming, polished interior disruptor.","['defensive', 'ford', 'ot', 'pick', 'giants', 'titans', 'odell', 'rosen', 'trade', 'williams', 'offensive', 'tackle', 'qb', 'line', 'edge', 'nfl', 'need', 'mock', 'josh']","In other words, New York still has a glaring need on the outside of their defensive line.

With the Giants having traded all-world wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to Cleveland, the Browns — yes, the Browns — have instantly become one of the most desired draws by NFL TV partners NBC, CBS, FOX, ESPN and NFL Network.

The teaming of the 26-year-old Beckham with Baker Mayfield, Cleveland's charismatic, 23-year-old quarterback, makes the Browns must-see TV. If they live up to their billing, look for them to make nationally televised appearances across NBC's ""Sunday Night Football,"" ESPN's ""Monday Night Football"" and FOX/NFL Network's ""Thursday Night Football"" in 2019.

NBC Sports' ""Sunday Night Football"" has reigned as TV's No. 1 prime-time show for eight straight seasons.

""The Browns are certainly a team on the rise and, like everyone else, we're excited to see what the NFL will do with them in primetime,"" wrote an NBC spokesman.

The sad-sack Browns previously had been exiled to local TV siberia. But Mayfield brought excitement as the No. 1 overall pick in 2018, and the Browns last season appeared on two nationally televised games on NFL Network.

They delivered. Mayfield's dramatic debut against the Jets (and No. 3 overall pick Sam Darnold) in Week 3 was the highest-rated TNF game in nearly three years.

Typically, the most sought-after NFL teams by TV networks are the Cowboys, Steelers, Packers, Patriots and Giants; the clubs with loyal national fan bases and the teams that draw the highest ratings. Now Tony Romo of CBS and Cris Collinsworth of NBC might want to look into waterfront condos on the mistake by the lake.

The Browns are already being discussed as Super Bowl contenders. If their offense with Beckham, Mayfield, running back Nick Chubb and receiver Jarvis Landry lives up to expectations, then football TV viewers will get to see more Browns games than the amount showed during the days of Bernie Kosar.

TIMELINE: How the Browns transformed so quickly

Don't be surprised if the NFL pencils in the Browns for a nationally televised season-opener when the league releases its schedule this spring. And if they win games, look for the Browns to appear frequently in the late slot of afternoon doubleheaders.

But like many fans, he's already fantasizing about what his team's new offense will look like.

On Friday, Mayfield made a surprise visit to the Milwaukee Brewers' Spring Training facility in Phoenix, Ariz. Only the topic of conversation wasn't his bromance with reigning National League MVP Christian Yelich, but rather what it will be like teaming up with one of the best receivers in football.

""It's gonna be exciting,"" Mayfield told reporters in the Brewers' clubhouse. ""We've got two LSU Tigers we're throwing to (Beckham and Jarvis Landry) and obviously we have a lot more talent too. So it's going to be a thing where you pick your poison.""

In trading for Beckham, Cleveland acquired not only a 3-time Pro Bowl receiver, but also one of the charismatic athletes in all of sports. Mayfield -- who is no stranger to personality, himself -- however doesn't think Beckham will have any issue fitting into the Browns' locker room that already includes himself and the eccentric Landry.

""You could say the same thing about me. You don't want to tame it,"" Mayfield said. ""You just let them be themselves and make plays. That's who they are. When it comes down to it, the guys in that locker room, you're going to love playing with them.

""I know from Saquon [Barkley] and Sterling Shephard, who I'm very close with, I know exactly who OBJ is inside the locker room and who he is to his teammates. That's the most important thing. People can have their attitudes and perspective on it, but he's himself and he also has his teammates' backs.""

On Wednesday, the Browns completed the trade in which they acquired Beckham from the New York Giants in exchange for a 2019 first and third-round picks, as well as safety Jabrill Peppers.

Moments after the trade was first reported, Mayfield took to Instagram to welcome his new teammate, who he worked out with alongside Landry last offseason.

The No. 12 pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, Beckham spent the first five seasons of his career in New York, where he amassed 390 receptions, 5,476 yards and 44 touchdowns. Adding one of the most talented wide receivers in football to what was already one of the NFL's most exciting young offenses, the Browns have only seen their expectations increase coming off of last season's 7-8-1 record.

Odell Beckham has taken criticism in the past for his passion overflowing on the field.

Cleveland Browns general manager John Dorsey doesn't seem to mind.

""I know Odell is very passionate,"" Dorsey told reporters Thursday. ""I know he is competitive. I know he can help this football team, and if you get a chance to acquire a guy like that, you know what, take a shot at it. We acquired him.""

The Browns traded a first- and third-round pick along with safety Jabrill Peppers to the Giants this week for Beckham, a deal that's widely been lauded as a steal. Beckham has been an All-Pro and Pro Bowler in three of his first five seasons, though the last two have been marred by injuries.

""We all understand the magnitude of his ability to play the game of football,"" Dorsey said.

Beckham recorded 77 receptions for 1,052 yards and six touchdowns last season while playing in 12 games. He's missed 16 games over the past two seasons.

Not known to hold off on his opinions, Beckham also made headlines after an interview in which he criticized the Giants offense and wondered aloud whether the team would be better moving on from Eli Manning.

Giants general manager Dave Gettleman, the source of most fan frustration, defended the trade Wednesday by pointing to the team's draft picks.

""With the first-round draft choice, that gives us (pick) six and 17,"" Gettleman said. ""As we continue to build this team, you need draft pick capital. This trade enabled us to do that.""

The Browns will go into 2019 with one of the most formidable offenses in football. Beckham joins a unit that includes franchise quarterback Baker Mayfield, former LSU teammate Jarvis Landry, running backs Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt and tight end David Njoku.

Odell Beckham Jr.'s departure starts a new era for the New York Giants. Or does it? (Seth Wenig/AP)

Reporter

The decision to trade perhaps the NFL’s most dynamic player, wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., in Tuesday night’s megadeal suggests that New York Giants General Manager Dave Gettleman has committed to a deconstruction of the team’s roster and a full-scale rebuild.

The problem: That roster still includes 38-year-old Eli Manning as, at least for now, the apparent starter at quarterback.

Those confoundingly mixed messages had many in and around the league wondering, in the wake of Tuesday’s jarring news, just what Gettleman and the Giants are doing. To which approach — win now or restock for the future — are they committed?

“So are they rebuilding now?” an agent who represents a number of free agents said Tuesday. “I’m not sure I can figure it out.”

[With Odell Beckham Jr. trade, the Browns just became Super Bowl contenders]

Others were equally baffled.

“The [G]iants didn’t even get the Browns[‘] best third,” former Browns and Philadelphia Eagles executive Joe Banner wrote on Twitter of a trade in which the Giants will receive first- and third-round draft picks as well as safety Jabrill Peppers. “Gettleman has made one inexplicable decision after another since he got the job. Hard to explain any, forget all of his moves.”

The Giants had an opportunity last offseason to commit to a rebuilding project. They were coming off a 3-13 season in 2017 that had cost General Manager Jerry Reese and Coach Ben McAdoo their jobs. McAdoo had awkwardly sat down Manning to end the quarterback’s lengthy streak of consecutive starts. The Giants possessed the second selection in a quarterback-rich draft. Beckham had vexed the Giants with his off-field behavior, leading co-owner John Mara to declare publicly last March that the team would listen to trade offers for the gifted wideout.

It would have been easy for Gettleman to trade Beckham last offseason, use the No. 2 pick on quarterback Sam Darnold and put Manning’s farewell tour in motion. The team’s fans probably would have accepted that and waited relatively patiently as the team attempted to build a contender around Darnold.

Instead, Gettleman used the selection on running back Saquon Barkley, left Manning in the starter’s role and failed to put a quarterback of the future in place. The Giants retained Beckham and signed him to a new contract. It was a win-now approach for a team not particularly equipped to win now.

The results were calamitous. Barkley was terrific; he was the NFL’s offensive rookie of the year. But Manning, playing behind a leaky offensive line, looked old and, at times, done. The Giants went 5-11 and finished last in the NFC East. Beckham, new contract and all, conducted a televised interview in which he questioned the offensive approach of first-year coach Pat Shurmur, failed to offer an endorsement of Manning and left many wondering whether he wanted to remain in New York.

So much for the win-now approach.

[NFL free agency news: Odell Beckham Jr. traded to Browns; Jets land C.J. Mosley]

Is Gettleman rebuilding? Perhaps. He has gotten rid of Beckham, and he has the sixth and 17th picks in the draft. He presumably can get whichever rookie quarterback he wants — unless that’s Kyler Murray and the Arizona Cardinals take him with the No. 1 pick.

Here’s the issue: It’s a year late for that. Last year’s draft was the time to go quarterback shopping. This year’s? Not so much.

“WOW!” former Giants great Carl Banks wrote on Twitter. “This is officially a ‘trust the process’ moment for fans … so many questions to be answered.

He will not appeal, so he’ll miss half of the 2019 regular season, his first with the Browns, after he excelled for two seasons with the Chiefs.

So what does this mean for the Browns’ rebuild with quarterback Baker Mayfield and former Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr.?

At this point — and considering the Browns knew a Hunt suspension was coming — they have enough weapons to get through his absence.

They have Mayfield in Year 2 and now Beckham (arriving via trade) and returning receiver Jarvis Landry. They added pass rusher Olivier Vernon (also via trade with the Giants). They signed defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson to further bolster their front seven.

NFL Draft 2019: Rashan Gary to Giants or Jets? Top-10 prospect teases N.J. homecoming, skips working out at Michigan’s pro day N.J. native and potential top-10 NFL Draft pick Rashan Gary won't work out at Michigan's pro day on Friday.

Oh, and there’s this: Just last season, the Browns saw their second-round draft pick, running back Nick Chubb, put together a strong rookie year. He had 996 rushing yards and eight touchdowns, while averaging a whopping 5.2 yards per carry. He was fifth in the NFL in yards per rush.

So while Hunt is an intriguing player (presuming he can stay out of trouble), it’s not like the Browns had a slouch at running back. And it’s not like they invested heavily in Hunt — just a modest, one-year contract.

The Browns won’t miss Hunt all that much, as long as Chubb can stay healthy and the Mayfield/Beckham/Landry trio can do its part.

Now, everyone can get back to worrying about just when (Week 1 in prime time?) the NFL will schedule Beckham’s return to MetLife Stadium, as the Browns are set to visit the Jets this season.

Cap hit

The Giants take a $16 million dead money hit to their salary cap in 2019. That leaves them with $33.656 million in dead money. So, it looks ugly for 2019. It’s not all bad, though. Patricia Traina explained for Forbes:

Beckham was due a $16.75 million base salary and a $250K workout bonus for a total of $17 million cash due this year. He will count for $16 million in dead money, so if we deduct the dead money from the 2019 cash projection, that’s a $1 million net savings. Peppers, who is still on his rookie deal, has a $1,405,204 cap hit for the Giants. (The remainder of his prorated signing bonus won’t hit the Giants cap). So when it’s all said and done, it doesn’t look like a massive savings for 2019; however, an early projection per Over the Cap has the Giants with $103,875,639 of available cap space for 2020—more than enough to cover the cost of the franchise tag and transition tag (teams will be allowed to use both in the final league year of the CBA, which is 2020). One final note about the salary cap. The absorption of the $16 million in dead money from the Beckham trade and the $8 million from the Vernon trade (in addition to what was on the books before) now pushes the Giants dead money to a league-high $33,656,400.

Now the Browns are the AFC North favorites for the 2019 season after trading for Odell Beckham Jr. just before the beginning of free agency. The Browns are a ridiculously fun team now, season tickets are selling like hot cakes, and fans are loving life.

One fan was loving life so much after the Beckham trade that it scared his neighbor into calling the police.

“After everyone shared their combined excitement, the future General Manager for the Browns quietly returned to his residence to resume his festivities without disturbing the neighbors,” the police department told Fox 8 in Cleveland.

And what if the Browns win a Super Bowl?

“I might be flying,” Stewart said.

That’s probably a bit premature, but the excitement is certainly warranted. Beckham is second all-time in receiving yards per game with an average of 92.8, and only Antonio Brown and DeAndre Hopkins have more receiving touchdowns since Beckham entered the league in 2014. That’s despite the fact that Beckham has missed 16 games in the last two seasons.

He’s as dynamic an offensive player as there is in the NFL, and he joins a team that has many other exciting young players in place. All the enthusiasm from Cleveland fans hasn’t gone unnoticed either.","['scaring', 'stewart', 'neighbors', 'receiving', 'browns', 'excitement', 'season', 'beckham', 'odell', 'trade', 'woman', 'fans', 'jr', 'cleveland', 'young', 'team']","For the first time in a long time, it’s great to be a Cleveland Browns fan.

15,http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/26246212/operating-plan-how-new-york-giants-failed-odell-beckham-jr,"Adam Schefter reports that the Giants have traded Odell Beckham Jr. to the Browns for a first-round pick, a third-round pick and safety Jabrill Peppers. (0:56)

Odell Beckham Jr. made it clear early that he was a bit of a different guy. I remember stopping at his locker during his rookie year when the wide receiver stuck out his right hand, with fingers as long as garden hoses, and introduced himself by name before I could do the same. It was a really minor thing, but I'm pretty sure it was the first time in my three decades of sportswriting that a star athlete had done that.

Beckham would use that right hand and those endless fingers he said were passed down from his mother, a former track star, to make perhaps the NFL's most stunning regular-season touchdown catch ever in a November loss to the Dallas Cowboys. That was a window into Beckham's career with the New York Giants: moments of breathtaking brilliance set against a mind-numbing series of defeats.

On Tuesday night, Giants general manager Dave Gettleman traded Beckham to the Cleveland Browns for the 17th overall pick in next month's draft, a third-round pick and safety Jabrill Peppers, who played his high school ball about a dozen miles from MetLife Stadium. Gettleman made this move not even seven months after signing Beckham to a record five-year, $95 million contract.

""We got him until he's 108,"" the GM joked that late-summer day.

As it played out, Gettleman got rid of the receiver before he even turned 27.

The old-school Giants have a card-carrying old-school GM in Gettleman, and there is no doubt that the receiver's high-maintenance ways contributed to his exit. Beckham engaged cornerback Josh Norman in the octagon, lost a fistfight with a kicking net, proposed marriage to said kicking net, took a boating vacation before his dreadful playoff performance against Green Bay -- and then punched a hole in a Lambeau Field wall -- and sat with Lil Wayne and ESPN's Josina Anderson and questioned everything from Eli Manning's arm to the team's heart.

Tom Coughlin, two-time Super Bowl-champion coach with the Giants, once said that Beckham brought qualities to the Giants ""the likes of which I've never seen."" And yet three head coaches (Coughlin, Ben McAdoo and Pat Shurmur), two general managers (Jerry Reese and Gettleman) and one team president and co-owner (John Mara) could never quite figure out how to manage Beckham and how to channel his boundless energy in a less disruptive direction.

Mara, Gettleman and Shurmur ultimately threw up their hands and said enough's enough. They sent Beckham to go play with his dear friend and LSU teammate, Jarvis Landry, and dynamic young quarterback Baker Mayfield, who stands as the polar opposite of the Giants' Manning.

The fast-breaking Browns are all set to fill the LeBron void in Cleveland.

But the Giants?

""Now they are in a full-blown rebuild, and 38-year-old Eli is still there,"" one league executive said Tuesday night. ""The running back, [Saquon] Barkley, is a first-ballot Hall of Famer if he stays healthy, but the problem is he's not a quarterback.""

In his five seasons with New York, Beckham eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards four times and caught 44 touchdowns. Seth Wenig/AP Photo

In drafting Barkley with the second overall pick, and in signing Beckham to his record deal in August, the Giants declared their intent to surround the declining Manning with enough explosive playmakers to lift him back to contending form. They finished 5-11 with that plan.

The Giants' new plan involves bringing back Manning and then trading the most physically talented player they've drafted since Lawrence Taylor, absorbing a $16 million dead-cap hit on the receiver's deal in the process. In committing franchise-player money over five years to a genuine star, then bailing on him less than seven months later, the Giants organization showed why it has missed the playoffs in six of the past seven seasons.

Yes, Beckham was a handful who demanded constant care. He's not an easy employee, and he couldn't always stay on the field.

But he was a spectacular player when he was on the field, as the fastest player to 200 catches and 3,000 yards in league history (30 games). Beckham was an incredible steal as the 12th pick of the 2014 draft, and the Giants had to try everything to keep him for the long term.

Their surrender was an organizational failure, from top to bottom.

""We didn't sign him to trade him,"" Gettleman had said. Of course, if the Giants were going to move Beckham to Cleveland, they should have tried like hell before last year's draft, before they paid him the big bucks. They could've tried offering Beckham to the Browns in a package for the fourth pick, and perhaps ended up with quarterback Sam Darnold (at No. 2) and Barkley (at No. 4, after the Jets took a quarterback at No. 3). Then the Giants would've been in business.

Instead, people around the league are trying to figure out what, exactly, they're trying to accomplish. Some executives believe that the Giants might pass on Ohio State's Dwayne Haskins at No. 6, turn 2019 into a start-to-finish Eli farewell tour that will placate the fans, to some extent, during a 3-13 season, and then draft Manning's replacement in 2020.

Whatever they do, and whatever the actual plan is, the Giants failed themselves and their fan base by shipping out their otherworldly receiver. They are in the business of gathering and developing talent, and they didn't develop Beckham. They gave up on him instead. And they reminded the rest of the sport why they have lost 24 of their past 32 games.","['receiver', 'browns', 'pick', 'beckham', 'giants', 'quarterback', 'draft', 'odell', 'york', 'jr', 'gettleman', 'star', 'failed', 'seven']","Adam Schefter reports that the Giants have traded Odell Beckham Jr. to the Browns for a first-round pick, a third-round pick and safety Jabrill Peppers.

What was a low-key need early in the draft process suddenly turned into a gaping hole on their roster with the move to trade Odell Beckham Jr.

The Giants might not prioritize the position highly, but their receiving cupboard is bare outside of Sterling Shepard -- who is in the last year of his free agency deal. Whether or not they will select a wide receiver highly in the 2019 NFL Draft, they should at least take a close look at the top of the depth chart.

And while there are bigger and more athletic prospects, NC State wide receiver Kelvin Harmon could make a lot of sense for the Giants.

Measurables

Pros

Prototypical size and frame for an NFL receiver.

Great hands. Frames and plucks the ball out of the air.

Good, nuanced route runner. Runs a variety of routes from both sides of the field and features a variety of releases.

Uses his routes as well as physicality to create separation.

Skilled at finding.

Willing blocker and a good one at that.

Able to win the catch point in contested catch situations.

Consistently productive.

Cons

Below-average athlete.

Limited ability to create after the catch.

Could have issues separating against bigger, more athletic cornerbacks

Numbers Of Note

statistics from Dan Pizzuta

Harmon finished 16th in Target Yards Added in this class, at 2.02, about average of those wide receivers sampled.

Per the Sports Info Solutions Rookie Handbook, Harmon led this class of receivers in Receiving Expected Points Added at 61.8.

Harmon lined up in the slot on 13.3 percent of NC State pass plays

Prospect Video

What They’re Saying

“Logging back-to-back 1,000-yard receiving seasons, Harmon has been one of the ACC’s most productive receivers over the last two seasons. He is a true alpha with dominant play strength. His burst and play speed for his size is underrated. His blend of size, physicality, ball skills and fluidity make him and ideal fit as an x-receiver in any scheme. By year three, Harmon has the upside to be relied upon as a true No. 1 receiver that keeps the chains moving, hits big plays and thrives in the redzone.”

- Joe Marino (The Draft Network - Scouting Report)

Does He Fit The Giants?

Much of the Giants’ passing offense is predicated on getting the ball into playmakers’ hands and letting them do their thing in space. Harmon is a different kind of receiver than Odell Beckham Jr. or Sterling Shepard, however. He isn’t the kind of receiver who can take a slant and turn it into a highlight reel play. His game is more like JuJu Smith-Schuster, DeAndre Hopkins, or Hakeem Nicks: While he can make big plays, he isn’t the kind of player who can out-athlete defenses.

But that doesn’t mean that he isn’t a viable receiver or a potential fit in the Giants’ scheme. He is a savvy, nuanced route runner who should be able to pick up the Giants’ concept-based passing game quickly and use his physicality and hands to maximize passing windows. He is also a willing and capable blocker who shows flashes of dominance, which will help when other players have the ball.

Going by his film, Harmon should be high on teams’ draft boards. However, like Nicks, Hopkins, and Smith-Schuster, Harmon’s pedestrian athleticism could cause a slide in favor of more athletically excellent prospects. If so, he could be a second-round steal for a team looking to add to their receiving corps.","['receiver', 'receiving', 'size', 'kelvin', 'state', 'giants', 'wide', 'odell', 'wr', 'harmon', 'replace', 'draft', 'receivers', 'play', 'jr', 'physicality', 'help', 'nc']","The New York Giants need to address their wide receiving corps.

In a blockbuster trade that alters the course of two NFL franchises, the New York Giants agreed to send standout wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to the Cleveland Browns, two people familiar with the deliberations said Tuesday night.

The Browns are expected to send first- and third-round picks in the upcoming draft and safety Jabrill Peppers to the Giants for Beckham, one of the NFL’s most dynamic players. The trade can become official Wednesday, when the new league year begins.

Beckham becomes the second star NFL wide receiver traded in recent days. The Pittsburgh Steelers agreed over the weekend to send Antonio Brown to the Oakland Raiders for third- and fifth-round draft choices.

The Giants will receive considerably more for Beckham. They get Peppers, considered by some a star in the making and a potential replacement for Landon Collins, who is leaving the Giants via free agency after agreeing to a six-year, $84 million contract with the Washington Redskins. And they receive the draft’s No. 17 selection, plus a third-round choice that the Browns had gotten from the New England Patriots in the trade that sent defensive tackle Danny Shelton to New England.

Still, many in and around the league were wondering why the Giants would part with a player as supremely gifted as Beckham, a three-time Pro Bowl selection at 26. Beckham made spectacular catches seem routine and has been highly productive, with 390 catches for 5,476 yards and 44 touchdowns over five seasons.

“At this point, I have no idea what to think,” Beckham told NFL Network on Tuesday night. “I’m trying to process it right now.”

Beckham told the league’s TV channel that he had had a “brief” conversation with General Manager Dave Gettleman, and he called leaving New York “bittersweet, but it is what it is. It’s life.”

Gettleman had said in recent weeks that the Giants had not signed Beckham to a new contract with the intention of trading him. A person familiar with the team’s thinking said this week that the Giants were not actively shopping Beckham but were listening to any offers from other teams.

Beckham’s off-field behavior irked Giants officials at times over the years. Co-owner John Mara said last March at the annual league meeting that he was “tired of answering questions” about Beckham’s off-field issues and that the team would listen to trade offers for Beckham. That came soon after video had surfaced on social media of Beckham alongside a woman who had a credit card and what appeared to be a white powdery substance.

“First of all, I don’t know what was in that video exactly,” Mara said then. “But I’ve said before that I’m tired of answering questions about Odell’s behavior and what the latest incident is. I think he knows what we expect of him, and now it’s up to him.”

The Giants didn’t trade Beckham then, instead signing him in August to a new five-year contract worth as much as $95 million. That deal was part of Gettleman’s approach of doubling down on the Giants’ present rather than beginning a rebuilding project. He retained veteran quarterback Eli Manning and used the second selection in last year’s draft on a running back, Saquon Barkley, instead of getting Manning’s eventual successor at quarterback.

Barkley had a successful season and was named the NFL’s offensive rookie of the year. But the Giants stumbled their way to a 5-11 record and finished last in the NFC East. They have retained Manning, who turned 38 in January. But the trade of Beckham leaves room to wonder whether they now are in rebuilding mode.

The Browns’ rebuilding under General Manager John Dorsey is on fast-forward. Things are looking up after the Browns went 7-8-1 last season and remained in AFC playoff contention until late in the season. Baker Mayfield, the quarterback taken first in last year’s draft, appears to be the real deal, and now he has Beckham among his receivers. Could the Browns be building a powerhouse?

“We all know it’s a quarterback-driven league, and you have to have certain pieces in place to move a team forward,” Dorsey said at the NFL scouting combine. “It just so happens to be the quarterback position. You first and foremost have to get that position right, regardless of if it’s a trade or the draft or unrestricted free agency. You build your team around that.”

Dorsey was asked at the combine about trading for Brown and, referring to Steelers executive Kevin Colbert, said: “I’m not going to talk about another team’s players. But if Kevin, you’re out there, here’s my cellphone right here.”

He then was asked about the possibility of trading for Beckham and, referring to Gettleman, Dorsey said: “Well, Dave, here’s my cellphone over here.”

It seemed at the time like just playful banter. By Tuesday night, though, that banter had developed into a deal that changed the NFL’s landscape.

On Tuesday night -- just three days after the Raiders traded for Antonio Brown -- the Browns pulled off a monumental trade with the Giants for Odell Beckham, as first reported by NFL Network's Mike Garafolo and confirmed by CBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora. In return for one of the best receivers in football, the Giants acquired the Browns' first-round pick, second third-round pick, and 2017 first-round pick Jabrill Peppers, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.

The trade actually happened. Beckham is on the Browns, and he immediately transforms them into the best team in the AFC North. The Giants are suddenly without their best player, and they didn't even get the two first-round picks that many believed would be a requirement in any trade involving Beckham.

Obviously, the winners and losers from Tuesday's blockbuster won't be known for some time. We need to see how the Giants use those draft picks. The players drafted with those picks need to be given a chance to step foot on the field in a Giants uniform. We also need to see how Beckham meshes with Baker Mayfield in Cleveland in addition to considering his impact within the ...

Oh, who are we kidding? Let's sort through the chaos and grade the trade right now, because as it stands, there's one very clear winner and one very clear loser. Yes, that could always change over time, but as of right now, give the Browns loads of credit for making the biggest move of the offseason and criticize the Giants for not getting as good of a haul that a player of Beckham's caliber should've fetched in the trade market.

We begin with the Browns.

Cleveland Browns: A

Odell Beckham

The Browns won this trade.

They just acquired arguably the league's best receiver who is both 26 years old and under contract for five more seasons with an average annual base salary of roughly $14.5 million. Even if the Browns end up reworking Beckham's contract to give him more money, they just added arguably the league's best receiver, who is still in his prime, and they didn't even have to give up multiple first-round picks. Heck, they didn't even have to give up the first of their two third-round picks. Even after parting ways with two draft picks, they're still armed with eight picks in the upcoming draft, two of which are a second- and third-round pick.

Here's what they're getting: Since Beckham entered the league in 2014, he ranks third in receiving yards per game with 92.8, slotting in behind Julio Jones and Antonio Brown. In that span, he also ranks third in touchdown catches with 44 even though he's missed 21 possible games. Put another way, DeAndre Hopkins ranks second with 45 touchdown catches, but he's played in 20 more games than Beckham in that span.

Translation: Beckham is in the top tier of NFL receivers. That much is indisputable.

He turns the Browns into the best team in the AFC North one year after they went 7-8-1 with their young nucleus, even after Hue Jackson actively sabotaged them during the first half the season. The Steelers just lost Antonio Brown. The Ravens lost C.J. Mosley and Eric Weddle. The Bengals are still the Bengals. The Browns added Odell Beckham to an offense that already has Baker Mayfield, Nick Chubb, Jarvis Landry, Antonio Callaway, David Njoku, and Kareem Hunt -- not to mention a defense that ranked 12th in DVOA.

This is good:

Browns offense ...



QB: Mayfield

RB: Chubb

WR: Beckham

WR: Landry

LT: Robinson

LG: Bitonio

C: Tretter

RG: Corbett

RT: Hubbard

TE: Njoku

WR: Callaway



... That's pretty good. And the defensive talent's not bad either. — Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) March 13, 2019

According to SportsLine's Stephen Oh, the Browns' chance of winning the AFC North has risen to 50.5 percent with Beckham. Their projected number of wins has jumped to 10.1.

That's a clear win.

New York Giants: F

First-round pick this year (No. 17 overall)

Third-round pick this year (No. 95 overall)

Jabrill Peppers



Let's start with the obvious: The Giants just got significantly worse by parting ways with one of the league's best receivers. Again, that's undeniable.

Clear difference in philosophy: The Browns have figured out that having good players is good. The Giants? Well they think having good players is bad. We’ll see who is right. — Kevin Clark (@bykevinclark) March 13, 2019

What's especially concerning about this trade from their perspective is that they didn't even get two first-round picks, which is what many assumed they'd get if they decided to trade Beckham. As NFL Network's Kimberly Jones said on Tuesday shortly before the trade, ""Would two No. 1 picks do it? Perhaps, but there doesn't seem to be a team lining up with that kind of mega offer for Odell Beckham Jr.""

In the end, the Giants settled for the No. 17 pick, the No. 95 pick, and Peppers.

If the Giants had called around and told teams that the best offer they had for OBJ was a 1, 3 + starting safety, would anyone have beat it? Hard to believe this is the best they could do. — Kevin Seifert (@SeifertESPN) March 13, 2019

Maybe they'll draft a great player with those picks. Given the draft is a crapshoot, it's more likely that they won't hit on both picks. It's even more unlikely that either of those picks will result in a player as impactful as Beckham. In Peppers, the Browns are getting a good, but not great young safety who will replace Landon Collins. He'll be a nice addition, but he's not magically transforming that Giants' defense into a top unit.

The timing of the trade, which factors into their grade, is also puzzling. If the Giants were so eager to get rid of Beckham that they settled for the Browns' offer, why didn't they trade him a year ago before they handed him a five-year extension?

The Giants paid Odell Beckham $21.459 million in 2018 as part of his new 5-year $90 million contract. He played 12 games before season-ending quad injury. What a waste of money. If they were going to dump him, they should have traded him last year before signing him. — Gary Myers (@GaryMyersNY) March 13, 2019 If the Giants were sick of Beckham's antics, they never should have given him that $90M extension. Not pay him and then trade him away. — Lindsay Jones (@bylindsayhjones) March 13, 2019

Not only that, but according to Over The Cap, the Giants will take on $16 million in dead money too. That's a significant amount of money to be paying a player who doesn't play for your team anymore.

This is not a list teams want to be on. To no one's surprise, the Steelers and Giants are both on it after dealing away their highly paid receivers.

Even Giants general manager Dave Gettleman indicated two months ago that trading Beckham so soon after signing him to an extension wouldn't make much sense.

Gettleman: We didn’t sign Odell to trade him. — New York Giants (@Giants) January 2, 2019

The Giants are now committed to a full rebuild one year after they passed on drafting a potential franchise quarterback in order to take a running back with the second-overall pick. While Saquon Barkley has proven to be a tremendous talent, his awesome rookie season also proved that he alone can't turn the Giants into contenders. Considering the Giants are in the beginning stages of their rebuild -- Eli Manning is still their quarterback -- it's not at all unreasonable to suggest that by the time the Giants are ready to compete, Barkley will no longer be on his rookie deal.

This is a disaster for the Giants. They traded away their best player in the prime of his career for a disappointing price less than a year after they gave him a huge contract. They're now beginning a rebuild one year after taking a running back over a quarterback with the No. 2 pick in the draft.

It's almost like they've been operating without a clear plan or direction.","['browns', 'pick', 'huge', 'losers', 'giants', 'beckham', 'winners', 'odell', 'wr', 'trade', 'picks', 'player', 'didnt', 'grades', 'jr', 'best', 'good', 'utter']","Beckham is on the Browns, and he immediately transforms them into the best team in the AFC North.
